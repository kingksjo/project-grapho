revised, superior logic for the `GET /recommendations` endpoint.

### **Revised Logic for `GET /recommendations` (Profile-Based Content Model)**

This version creates a "taste profile" for the user by averaging the features of several movies they like.

**Input:** A `GET` request to `/recommendations`. The request must include a valid JWT.

**1. Authentication & User Identification (Same as before)**
*   **Action:** Validate the JWT and extract the `user_id`.

**2. Building the User's "Taste Profile"**
*   **Concept:** Instead of finding just one source movie, we will gather a representative sample of the user's positive interactions.
*   **Action:** The endpoint will connect to the database and query the `interactions` table. It will fetch the `movie_id`s for the **last 10-15 movies** that this `user_id` has `'like'`d.
*   **Result:** We get a list of movie IDs (e.g., `[1, 5, 88, 102, ...]`). We then look these up to get their unique `title_year` identifiers (e.g., `["Oppenheimer (2023)", "The Godfather (1972)", ...]`). This list of IDs represents the user's current taste profile.

**3. Calling the (New) Recommendation Engine**
*   **Action:** We will now call a new function, the `get_recommendations_from_profile()` function we blueprinted earlier. We pass the entire list of `title_year` IDs into it.
*   **Inside this new function:**
    1.  It will loop through the list of liked movies.
    2.  For each movie, it will find its corresponding feature vector from our `people_tfidf_matrix` and `genre_tfidf_matrix`.
    3.  It will then **average** all these vectors together to create a single "profile vector" for people and a "profile vector" for genres. This vector is the mathematical representation of the user's combined taste.
    4.  It will then use `cosine_similarity` to compare this *profile vector* against the entire universe of movies.
    5.  The rest of the logic (combining scores, filtering by popularity and recency) proceeds as before, but using the similarity scores relative to the user's overall profile.
*   **Result:** The function returns a DataFrame of the top 10 movies that best match the user's *overall taste*, not just a single movie.

**4. Enriching with TMDb (Same as before)**
*   **Action:** The endpoint will loop through the 10 recommended movies, call the TMDb API for each one using its `tconst`, and fetch the poster, overview, etc.

**5. Formatting and Returning the Response (Same as before)**
*   **Action:** The endpoint will format the enriched list into a JSON array and send it to the user's browser.

### **Why This Approach is Superior**

1.  **More Stable:** Recommendations will no longer change dramatically just because you liked one new movie. They will be based on the broader pattern of your taste.
2.  **More Personalized:** It captures the nuances of your taste. If you like both intense sci-fi movies (*Blade Runner 2049*) and quirky comedies (*The Grand Budapest Hotel*), your profile vector will be a blend of both, and the recommendations will reflect that diversity.
3.  **Handles "Cold Start" Gracefully:** For a brand new user who has only selected their top 5 favorite movies during onboarding, this list of 5 is their initial taste profile. The system can start giving personalized recommendations immediately.
